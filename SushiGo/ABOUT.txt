HOW TO PLAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game takes place over three rounds. To start a round all players simultaneously choose any 1 card from their hands that they would like to keep and place it facedown in front of them. When each player has done this, everyone reveals heir chosen cards. 
After revealing cards, pass your remaining hand facedown to the player on your left. Everyone picks up their new hands and the next turn begins. You have a new and smaller hand to choose from. 
Face up cards remains with you until the end of the round, when they are scored. I is helpful to group cards of the same type together.
